# Fuzzy Logic on IRIS classification

# Introduction
Iris is a flower data set which include three different species setosa, virginica andversicolor. This three species are distinguished by four features which are sepallength, sepal width, petal length and petal width. I build membership functions for this four different features. The code supports any number of rules, inputs, antecedents and implication operators. Fuzzy set-valued ouputs and corresponding defuzzified outputs would all be displayed. The best accuracy for the iris data classification is 97.33%.

# Procedure to run
  * **Input the implication operator** which are Lukasiewicz, Minimum and Product.
  * **Input any number of  antecedents.** For example, you can input "sl 1 sw 2 pl 3 pw 1". sl, sw, pl and pw represent sepal length, sepal width, pedal length and pedal width respectively. The number from 1 to 3 represent the low, medium and long in the membership function. The above input could be translated into "If sepal length is small and sepal width is large and pedal length is long and pedal width is narrow." Besides, any number of antecedents would be supported. The use could input whatever number of antecedents they want like "sl 1 pl 3"
  * **Input the implication operator** which are Lukasiewicz, Minimum and Product.
  * **Input the implication operator** which are Lukasiewicz, Minimum and Product.
