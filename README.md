# Fuzzy Logic on IRIS classification

# Introduction
Iris is a flower data set which include three different species setosa, virginica andversicolor. This three species are distinguished by four features which are sepallength, sepal width, petal length and petal width. I build membership functions for this four different features. The code supports any number of rules, inputs, antecedents and implication operators. Fuzzy set-valued ouputs and corresponding defuzzified outputs would all be displayed. The best accuracy for the iris data classification is 97.33%.

# Procedure to run
  * Input the implication operatorwhich are Lukasiewicz, Minimum and Product.
